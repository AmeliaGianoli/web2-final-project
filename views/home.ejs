    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of
      server-side development using Node.js and Express, dynamic rendering
      with EJS templates, and structured content using Markdown files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each blog post reflects a concept, tool, or idea I learned while pursuing my Web and Software Developer Degree.
